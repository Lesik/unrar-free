unrar is a free software version of the non-free unrar utility that exists
on many GNU/Linux systems today. It uses the GPL'd UniquE RAR Library by
Christian Scheurer and Johannes Winkelmann. This program is a simple
command-line front-end to this library, and can list and extract RAR
archives. It does not rival the non-free unrar in terms of features, but
special care has been taken to ensure it meets most user's needs and it is
hoped that GUI archivers such as GNOME's (file-roller) and KDE's ark will
use this utility as a back-end.

	Usage: unrar [OPTION...] ARCHIVE [FILE...] [DESTINATION]
	Extract files from rar archives.
 
	  -x, --extract              Extract files from archive (default)
	  -t, --list                 List files in archive
	  -f, --force                Overwrite files when extracting
	      --extract-newer        Only extract newer files from the archive
	      --extract-no-paths     Don't create directories while extracting
	  -p, --password             Decrypt archive using a password
	  -?, --help                 Give this help list
	      --usage                Give a short usage message
	  -V, --version              Print program version
