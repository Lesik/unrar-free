	* src/unrarlib.h, src/Makefile.am: Moved the _DEBUG_LOG define into 
	Makefile.am, and commented it out.
	* src/opts.c (parse_opts): fixed calling of getpass, so it only gets
	called once even if --password is on the command-line twice.
	* src/opts.c (parse_opts): now using realloc(n,NULL) to behave like
	malloc(n), so that memory allocation only happens in one place.
	* src/Makefile.in: regenerated.
	* src/unrar.c: added Jeroen's name to the visible copyright notice.

	* src/opts.c (options): Put string constants directly in the
	structure.
